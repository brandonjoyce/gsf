                    The student's voice is an important part of the working Board of Trustees. Green High School juniors are selected through an application process. Many juniors elect to stay with the Foundation through their senior year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All students serve on board committees including Celebration of Education, Membership, Resource Development & Finance, Communication, and Enrichment.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Green Schools Foundation was formed in 1991 on the principle that the success of our local schools should be a shared responsibility.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            In 1992, the Foundation provided its first student scholarship – a single $500 award – and $5,000 in classroom grants. Since then, our organization has provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in direct financial support to students of Green Local Schools. This growth has been made possible by the enthusiastic support of our members and contributors.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            We are proud of our past and we want to take steps right now to ensure our future. Green Schools Foundation's mission is to promote academic excellence in the Green Local Schools.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">We will do this in the following ways:</p>

        <ul class="mb-4 pl-6">
            <li>Ensuring we have the right operating structure to be efficient and effective</li>
            <li>Expanding our scholarship and grant programs to offer larger awards to more students</li>
            <li>Working with other local organizations to make sure our efforts complement each other for the most positive impact on our community</li>
            <li>Increasing our visibility within Green so that more people know what we do and why we do it</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Finally, it is truly an honor to serve as president of the Green Schools Foundation. I have been actively involved with many organizations within the Green community and the Foundation is one that I believe benefits all students in Green Schools. As the Foundation grows we are always looking for individuals to join the Board of Trustees. If you would be interested, I would love to meet with you and discuss all the great things the Foundation is doing to promote the academic excellence in Green Schools.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            As always, thank you for your support of the Green Schools Foundation.
