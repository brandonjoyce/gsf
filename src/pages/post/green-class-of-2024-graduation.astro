        In just two weeks, the halls of our beloved school will echo with the joyous sounds of graduation. The Class of 2024 is set to don their caps and gowns and step forward into their bright futures.

        Among the graduating seniors is Nadia Otterstetter, a remarkable student who has served diligently as a GSF Student Liaison this past year. In celebration of her impending graduation, Nadia recently picked up her sign—a special offering provided by the Green Schools Foundation (GSF).
