        As the academic year draws to a close, the Green Schools Foundation is proud to celebrate the exemplary dedication and innovation of our teaching staff through our final Spotlight on Staff feature. This initiative highlights the outstanding efforts of educators who are not just teaching but truly making a difference in the lives of students and the broader community.

        This May, we had the distinct pleasure of recognizing three exceptional teachers at the Board of Education meeting. These educators exemplify the values of excellence, dedication, and innovation that the Green Schools Foundation strives to promote throughout the district.

        Our Spotlight on Staff program recognizes teachers and staff members who go above and beyond in their roles. Whether through innovative teaching methods, exceptional student support, or community involvement, these individuals represent the best of Green Local Schools.
