        The Green Schools Foundation is thrilled to highlight a wonderful partnership with Loving Hands Preschool that embodies our shared commitment to fostering educational opportunities within our community. Together, we have established the Loving Hands Preschool Scholarship, a testament to our joint belief in the potential of our youth and the power of education.

        This year, we are especially proud to announce that Grant Price, a distinguished Green High School senior and former Loving Hands graduate, has been awarded the scholarship. Grant's journey from Loving Hands Preschool to Green High School graduation exemplifies the lasting impact that quality early education can have on a student's academic trajectory.

        The Loving Hands Preschool Scholarship represents the Green Schools Foundation's commitment to supporting students at every stage of their educational journey. By partnering with local preschools like Loving Hands, we can recognize and support students who have demonstrated excellence throughout their academic careers.
